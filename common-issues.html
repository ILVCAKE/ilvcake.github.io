        <h2>Common Issues and Solutions</h2>

        <h3>1. Check Your Internet Connection</h3>
        <p>ReplicaISA needs an active internet connection to communicate with the server. üåê</p>
        <ul>
            <li>First, make sure you have a stable internet connection.</li>
            <li>Try visiting other websites or playing an online game.</li>
            <li>If you're having internet issues, try restarting your router or contacting your internet service provider.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Check Your Firewall and Antivirus</h3>
        <p>Sometimes firewalls and antivirus programs can block ReplicaISA from running properly. üõ°Ô∏è</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Temporarily disable your firewall and antivirus, then try running ReplicaISA again.</li>
            <li>If it works, you'll need to add ReplicaISA as an exception in your security software settings to use it normally.</li>
            <li>For instructions on how to do this, please refer to your firewall or antivirus documentation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. Run as Administrator</h3>
