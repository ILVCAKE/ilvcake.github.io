        <li><strong>Modify In-Game Sensitivity:</strong> Adjust your in-game aim sensitivity to find a balance with the aimbot.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Issue 3: The game freezes or crashes while using the aimbot.</h3>

    <h3>Issue 4: The aimbot is not properly detecting enemies.</h3>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Check Game Display Settings:</strong> Verify that your game's display settings (resolution, window mode, etc.) are compatible with ReplicaISA.</li>

        <li>Launch ReplicaISA.exe.</li>

    </ol>

    <h3>Issue 6: Receiving a 404 error.</h3>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>There might be an issue with the license server or the AAL server, causing a response error.</li>

    </ol>

    <h3>Issue 7: I got banned.</h3>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>If you have a previous HWID ban or account ban, even a new account is likely to be banned again due to logged records.</li>
        <li>RiSA (ReplicaISA) has not been detected or resulted in bans since Season 18.</li>
        <li>While excessive RAGE settings can lead to bans, avoid the following:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Using settings not provided by ConfigaSHOP.</li>
            <li>Using third-party programs (e.g., Don't buy GODAI; it's garbage. I used it and got a LEVEL3 HWID ban.)</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
